A very simple shopping cart system writen in using Flask/Python, Jinjai2 templates and Bootstrap for styling

First learning project with Flask so is very simple.  It takes a list of products, calculates the total and sends the details to Paypal.  It then checks the IPN and emails the administrator and customer the order details.

This is being witten for a shop that basically sells one product, with customisations and doesn't need the complexity of a full ecommerce solution.
